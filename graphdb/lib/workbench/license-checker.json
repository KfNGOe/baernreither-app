Visit http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/!\n\n# Installation\n\nInstallation is easy as UI Bootstrap has minimal dependencies - only the AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap's CSS are required.\nNote: Since version 0.13.0, UI Bootstrap depends on [ngAnimate](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate) for transitions and animations, such as the accordion, carousel, etc. Include `ngAnimate` in the module dependencies for your app in order to enable animation.\n\n#### Install with NPM\n\n```sh\n$ npm install angular-ui-bootstrap\n```\n\nThis will install AngularJS and Bootstrap NPM packages.\n\n#### Install with Bower\n```sh\n$ bower install angular-bootstrap\n```\n\nNote: do not install 'angular-ui-bootstrap'.  A separate repository - [bootstrap-bower](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap-bower) - hosts the compiled javascript file and bower.json.\n\n#### Install with NuGet\nTo install AngularJS UI Bootstrap, run the following command in the Package Manager Console\n\n```sh\nPM> Install-Package Angular.UI.Bootstrap\n```\n\n#### Custom build\n\nHead over to http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/ and hit the *Custom build* button to create your own custom UI Bootstrap build, just the way you like it.\n\n#### Manual download\n\nAfter downloading dependencies (or better yet, referencing them from your favorite CDN) you need to download build version of this project. All the files and their purposes are described here:\nhttps://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/tree/gh-pages#build-files\nDon't worry, if you are not sure which file to take, opt for `ui-bootstrap-tpls-[version].min.js`.\n\n### Adding dependency to your project\n\nWhen you are done downloading all the dependencies and project files the only remaining part is to add dependencies on the `ui.bootstrap` AngularJS module:\n\n```js\nangular.module('myModule', ['ui.bootstrap']);\n```\n\nIf you're a Browserify or Webpack user, you can do:\n\n```js\nvar uibs = require('angular-ui-bootstrap');\n\nangular.module('myModule', [uibs]);\n```\n\n# Support\n\n## FAQ\n\nhttps://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/wiki/FAQ\n\n## Supported browsers\n\nDirectives from this repository are automatically tested with the following browsers:\n* Chrome (stable and canary channel)\n* Firefox\n* IE 9 and 10\n* Opera\n* Safari\n\nModern mobile browsers should work without problems.\n\n\n## Need help?\nNeed help using UI Bootstrap?\n\n* Live help in the IRC (`#angularjs` channel at the `freenode` network). Use this [webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/) or your own IRC client.\n* Ask a question in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) under the [angular-ui-bootstrap](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular-ui-bootstrap) tag.\n\n**Please do not create new issues in this repository to ask questions about using UI Bootstrap**\n\n## Found a bug?\nPlease take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#you-think-youve-found-a-bug) and submit your issue [here](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/issues/new).\n\n\n----\n\n\n# Contributing to the project\n\nWe are always looking for the quality contributions! Please check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contribution guidelines.\n\n# Development, meeting minutes, roadmap and more.\n\nHead over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/wiki) for notes on development for UI Bootstrap, meeting minutes from the UI Bootstrap team, roadmap plans, project philosophy and more."

    "licenseText": "A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

The spec only\ndefaults to US-ASCII as charset if the entire type is not specified.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[rfc]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397",

Check out the [ngTagsInput website](http://mbenford.github.io/ngTagsInput) for more information.\n\n## Requirements\n\n - AngularJS 1.3+\n - A modern browser (Chrome 31+, Firefox 29+, Safari 7+, Opera 12+, IE 10+)\n\n## Installing\n\nAll files are available from a variety of sources. Choose the one that best fits your needs:\n\n- Direct download (https://github.com/mbenford/ngTagsInput/releases)\n- NPM (`npm install ng-tags-input --save`)\n- Bower (`bower install ng-tags-input --save`)\n- CDNJS (http://cdnjs.com/libraries/ng-tags-input)\n\nYou can also grab the [latest build](#latest-build) generated by Travis. It's fully functional and may contain new features and bugfixes not yet published to the services listed above.\n\nNow all you have to do is add the scripts to your application. Just make sure the `ng-tags-input.js` file is inserted **after** the `angular.js` script:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"angular.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"ng-tags-input.js\"></script>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"ng-tags-input.css\">\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n 1. Add the `ngTagsInput` module as a dependency in your AngularJS app;\n 2. Add the custom element `<tags-input>` to the HTML file where you want to use an input tag control and bind it to a property of your model. That property, if it exists, must be an array of objects and each object must have a property named `text` containing the tag text;\n 3. Set up the options that make sense to your application;\n 4. Enable autocomplete, if you want to use it, by adding the directive `<auto-complete>` inside the `<tags-input>` tag, and bind it to a function of your model. That function must return either an array of objects or a promise that eventually resolves to an array of objects (same rule from step 2 applies here);\n 5. Customize the CSS classes, if you want to.\n 6. You're done!\n\n**Note:** There's a more detailed [getting started](http://mbenford.github.io/ngTagsInput/gettingstarted) guide on the ngTagsInput website.\n\n## Example\n\n```html\n<html>\n<head>\n    <script src=\"angular.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"ng-tags-input.min.js\"></script>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"ng-tags-input.min.css\">\n    <script>\n        angular.module('myApp', ['ngTagsInput'])\n            .controller('MyCtrl', function($scope, $http) {\n                $scope.tags = [\n                    { text: 'just' },\n                    { text: 'some' },\n                    { text: 'cool' },\n                    { text: 'tags' }\n                ];\n                $scope.loadTags = function(query) {\n                     return $http.get('/tags?query=' + query);\n                };\n            });\n    </script>\n</head>\n<body ng-app=\"myApp\" ng-controller=\"MyCtrl\">\n    <tags-input ng-model=\"tags\">\n        <auto-complete source=\"loadTags($query)\"></auto-complete>\n    </tags-input>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Options\n\nCheck out the [documentation](http://mbenford.github.io/ngTagsInput/documentation/api) page for a detailed view of all available options.\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can see the directive in action in the [demo page](http://mbenford.github.io/ngTagsInput/demos).\n\n## Contributing\n\nBefore posting an issue or sending a pull request, make sure to read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/mbenford/ngTagsInput/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n## License\n\nSee the [LICENSE](https://github.com/mbenford/ngTagsInput/blob/master/LICENSE) file.\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mbenford/ngTagsInput/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) page.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nThe following are some alternatives to ngTagsInput you may want to check out:\n\n- [angular-tags](http://decipherinc.github.io/angular-tags): Pure AngularJS tagging widget with typeahead support courtesy of ui-bootstrap\n- [angular-tagger](https://github.com/monterail/angular-tagger): Pure Angular autocomplete with tags, no jQuery\n- [jsTag](https://github.com/eranhirs/jstag): Open source project for editing tags (aka tokenizer) based on AngularJS\n- [bootstrap-tagsinput](http://timschlechter.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples): jQuery plugin providing a Twitter Bootstrap user interface for managing tags (provides Angular support)\n\n## Latest build\n\n- Compressed: [ng-tags-input.min.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ng-tags-input/ng-tags-input.min.zip)\n- Uncompressed: [ng-tags-input.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ng-tags-input/ng-tags-input.zip)"
