# StoReCo 

Enhanced Stand-off TEI Annotation with StoReCo: A generic approach with the use of RDF.

This tool is still under development. Changes are possible at any time.

## Installation

StoReCo is written in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and uses [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) to build the Java library and executable.

### 1. Install Leiningen

Leiningen installs itself on the first run of the `lein` shell script; there is no
separate install script.  Follow these instructions to install Leiningen manually:

1. Make sure you have Java installed; OpenJDK version 8 is recommended at this time.
2. [Download the `lein` script from the `stable` branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein)
 of this project.
3. Place it on your `$PATH`. (`~/bin` is a good choice if it is on your path.)
4. Set it to be executable. (`chmod +x ~/bin/lein`)
5. Run it.

Windows users can use the above script in the Linux subsystem or try
[the batch file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein.bat) or
[Powershell version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein.ps1)
instead.

### 2. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KardungLa/StoReCo.git
```

```bash
cd StoReCo/storeco
lein uberjar
cd target/uberjar
```
